# Provision-an-instance-of-IBM-Db2-Lite-plan
IBM DB2 is a cloud native database database engine provides end-to-end management of transactional, operational and analytical dataâ€”across any cloud

In this project we have provision an instance of a relational database on IBM cloud. 
In order to access the cloud service it is very important to provision an instance. As I am using the cloud account, I am able to create and work on only one instance. 

Steps to provision are as follows: 
1) Click on the **Catalog** menu item and select **Services**. Scroll down and check the **Databases** box.
2) Scroll down and click on the tile for **Db2** service.
3) The **Create tab** will be active by default
4) Select location - I am using student account in which the services are present only in dallas and london. 
5) Scroll down to **Select a pricing plan** and select the **Lite** plan. (It is free)
6) Then click on the **Create** button on the bottom right of the page. // By default, the Getting started tab will be active.
7) Click on **Service credentials** and then on **New credential.**
8) Keep name as it is and click on **create**.


We have successfully created an instance of Db2 using your IBM Cloud Lite account.
